# Augmented Reality Exploration with ARKit

An undergraduate research project exploring the capabilities of ARKit for the Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science. The (unhosted) website contains a literature review of augmented reality and tutorials on how to get started with ARKit. 

## Getting Started
To run the site from the command line, `cd` to the project's root directory, start a simple web server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, and point your browser to http://localhost:8000/

## Sample Projects
Visit the [demo-apps](https://github.com/pg8wood/ARKit-Research/tree/master/demo-apps) folder to view the source code of the applications built in the tutorials on the website. Or, follow the tutorials and develop them yourself!
